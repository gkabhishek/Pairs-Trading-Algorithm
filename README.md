# Pairs-Trading-Algorithm

## Introduction:

Pairs Trading strategy has almost a 20-year history on Wall Street and the strategy involves finding two stocks whose prices have moved together historically. When the spread between them widens, short the winner and buy the loser. If history repeats itself, prices will converge, and the arbitrageur will profit.

## Objective: 
To develop a python program that identifies pairs best suited for pairs trading and generate buy/sell signal for the pair to get a deep understanding of pairs trading strategy.

## Note: 
The plotFunction.py file contains all the functions created to run the main program, such as downloading historical data for a ticker and  visualization functions
